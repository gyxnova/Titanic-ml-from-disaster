# Titanic Survival Prediction (ML Project)

This project uses the classic **Titanic dataset** to predict passenger survival using Machine Learning.  
The goal is to practice data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading** – Load Titanic dataset (train & test sets).
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked).
3. **Feature Engineering** – Encode categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`), create new features.
4. **Model Training** – Tried Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / RandomForest.
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy achieved: **62%** on validation set.
